# client-project-design
This is a project that codes and displays a portfolio for myself that has a clear, functional layout. This includes a website layout featuring a navigation bar, an About Me, a Projects section and a Contact section. This was done using div classes, section tags, a CSS Flexbox layout, and other HTML elements. Also, included in the files is a copy of my resume and a few images that display on the webpage.
